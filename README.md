# Mock-IU-Database
### I308 Information Representation Final Project

This is a group project wherein we created a mock database of IU-like structures using MySQL. We created 20 tables and wrote 7 select queries that are accessible online. Please excuse the look of the webpage; web design was not a priority or consideration of this project.

In this project, I created all tables as well as generated and linked all of the data. I assisted in writing most of the select statements and wrote a couple of them myself.
